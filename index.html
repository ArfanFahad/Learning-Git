                <p>Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha, who was allegedly forced to leave the country about seven years ago as a sitting chief justice, has said he is ready to return to Bangladesh and prove that all the cases filed against him are completely false and fabricated if the government ensures his security.

                    "I will go back to Bangladesh. I'm now waiting for a green signal," he said in an exclusive interview with The Daily Star from abroad via video call on August 14.</p>
